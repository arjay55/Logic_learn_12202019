# Logic_learn_12202019

Run GML.py to test the code.

The class method causation() adds a layer of logical connections from the previous one. The line 632 adds one layer from the existing one. The current code already has 2 layers so it will halt. Commenting it out will only have one, and thus the code will run correctly.
